Rah47685170,The function for java was being over-ridden by Marketo. The error message 1003 is not being handled well. Work is to be done on  exception handling.,Bulkapi should be used,Rahul Bishen,"Hi,
I received an inquiry from a customer that a ""Please use the BulkAPI connection property since you have exceeded the maximum of 100,000 ProgramMemberships that can be returned for the given Program"" error occurs when retrieving a custom object.
When I checked Marketo's Core.java, I found that the handling was such that it would return this error message if it returned an error code of 1003.
It is true that Marketo returns such an error code due to the restriction of getting ProgramMember, but in this case, we did not get ProgramMember, but 1003 was returned, so this message was displayed to the client.

Shr32789201,The same canvas size dimensions should be used to get uniform svgs on the Data Cloud page,The svgs should be combined so that they get cached together and their load Time on cdata cloud page is reduced.,Shrawan,"Design Problem
The size of the logos are not uniform when it comes to the constrained proportions of the bounding box.
Design Solution: https://www.figma.com/file/Ee9bI2QhQDu2MX3utfK9Dw/CLOUD-500%3A-Improve-.svgs-on-Client-page?node-id=0%3A1 New .svg files can be found here.
Place all icons to fit within the same canvas size dimensions to ensure max-width/max-height makes sense based on the constrained proportions of each logo
Dev Problem: 
When on the page for the first time, the svgs take long to load, leaving about a half-second to second of blank icons making the page format look off.
Dev Solution
Look at options at how to best solve this.

In the current driver, when updating with PreparedStatement, you must use RecordId as a key. For example, if you execute the following code, you will get the error message ""Unable to execute the query, the filter is not comparing primary keys. 'Key'"".However, the API allows you to specify a unique field other than RecordId as a key during bulk update.
